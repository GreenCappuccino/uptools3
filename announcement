This is to announce the new release of the UNIPEN-related software
package:

    UPTOOLS, VERSION 3.2
    
This UNIX software is mainly intended for researchers in on-line
handwriting recognition. It allows for a hierarchical annotation
of on-line handwritten data coming from XY digitizers or pen
computers. The software is not intended for processing off-line
(i.e., optically scanned) handwriting data.  The purpose of this
software is to stimulate the use of the UNIPEN file format for
on-line handwriting recognition research. This is the same data
format as is used within the UNIPEN recognizer benchmark project
(http://hwr.nici.kun.nl/unipen/).

              can be viewed. There are many options for changing 
              graphical attributes (such as the color of segments).
